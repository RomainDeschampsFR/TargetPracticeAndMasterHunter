# TargetPracticeAndMasterHunter

* TARGET PRACTICE 

* Former ArcheryTargetPractice mod has been taken over and improved. (Thanks to TheKillerGreece, zeobiou
* "FirearmsTargetPractice" added (you can practice on spray paint, a recycled can or a bullseye)

(All the following are optional)

* MASTER HUNTER (This option is not compatible with SKILL MANAGER, all the others are)
* In short, your INGAME skill level = your IRL shooting skill level. You can't evolve through the skill level without being good at it (At least, that's what the mod's aiming for)
* It applies the same rules of training but for hunting as well 

* ADJUST SLIDERS : The higher your level, the greater the distance required to gain a skill point.
* You can still hunt at close range, but you won't increase your skills.
* 3 Presets : Beginner, Intermediate, Master (to be balanced)

* DISABLE SKILL POINTS FROM ARROW CRAFTING (Because you don't learn much how to shoot that way...)

* CHANGE READING TIME & SKILL POINTS FROM RESEARCH BOOKS (Because you don't learn much how to shoot that way either...)
* I also added all non-shooting books (before someone ask for it)

* DISPLAY POINT INCREASE SKILL ICON AFTER LVL5
* So you can know if you hit your target from very far away

* MELON LOADER LOG
* Give you the name of the target you hit and the distance between you and the target (One full rifle swing while walking ~ 5m)

* INCREMENTAL BONUS FEATURE
* Long shot at low level = more points. 1 more point for each distance increment

* AUTO SIDE-STEP WHILE TRAINING
* Each time you successfully hit a training target, your character takes a random side step. You'll need to analyze your surroundings more closely to strike twice (or more...) in a row.

# KNOWN ISSUES

* Recycled Cans aren't visible beyond 10 meters or so. making it impossible to train with them. 
* It's a vanilla bug, report this to HL if you hope training on them one day. https://hinterlandgames.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020142912-Reporting-Bugs

* Presets needs to be balanced.

# USEFUL CONSOLE COMMAND (F1)

* rifle (1 rifle & 100 ammos)
* revolver (1 revolver & 100 ammos)
* bow (1 bow & 100 ammos)
* add spraypaintcan (add a spray paint in your inventory)
* skill_archery_level X (replace X by 1 2 3 4 or 5 / replace archery by revolver/rifle)

# FUTURE FEATURES

* I'm going to try to add more bullseyes in the world (ideally 1 per region)
