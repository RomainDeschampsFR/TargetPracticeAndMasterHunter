### INCREMENTAL BONUS (OPTION)
* Long shot at low level = more points. 1 more point for each distance increment.

### HEADSHOT BONUS (OPTION)
* Earn one more skill point when you hit your target in the head.

### AUTO SIDE-STEP (OPTION)
* Each time you successfully hit a training target, your character takes a random side step. 
* You'll need to analyze your surroundings more closely to strike twice (or more...) in a row.

### HUD MESSAGE (OPTION)
* Gives you the name of the target you hit, the body part and the distance and the number of points earned.

### RECORD DISTANCE DISPLAY (HOTKEY)
* The mod saves the greatest distance from which you hit the target for each Target/Army pair. 
* You can try to hit a bear from 250 range if you have nothing more to do...

### DISPLAY SKILL ICON AFTER LVL 5 (OPTION)
* So even after you've reached level 5, you'll know if you've hit your target by a long way.

### MASTER HUNTER (OPTION : Not compatible with SKILL MANAGER, all others are)
* It applies the same distance rules and all options above for hunting.
* You can still hunt at close range, but you won't earn a skill point by default.

### DISABLE SKILL POINTS FROM ARROW CRAFTING (OPTION)
* *(Because you don't learn much how to shoot that way...)*

### CHANGE READING TIME & SKILL POINTS FROM RESEARCH BOOKS (OPTION)
* *(Because you don't learn much how to shoot that way either...)*
* I also added all non-shooting books (before someone ask for it)

## KNOWN ISSUES
